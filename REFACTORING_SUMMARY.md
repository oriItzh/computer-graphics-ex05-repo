# Basketball Game Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the monolithic `hw5.js` file by extracting game logic into modular systems. The main file is now clean and focused on coordination rather than implementation details.

## New System Architecture

### Core Systems Created:

#### 1. **BallPhysicsSystem** (`src/systems/ballPhysics.js`)
- Handles all physics calculations (gravity, velocity, trajectory)
- Manages ball rotation animations
- Controls ground collision and bouncing mechanics
- Encapsulates physics constants and state

#### 2. **ShootingSystem** (`src/systems/shootingSystem.js`)
- Manages shot power and angle controls
- Handles trajectory visualization (red dashed line)
- Provides UI updates for shooting parameters
- Encapsulates shooting mechanics and calculations

#### 3. **ScoringSystem** (`src/systems/scoringSystem.js`)
- Tracks score, attempts, accuracy, and statistics
- Manages combo system and consecutive shot bonuses
- Handles swoosh detection (clean shots without rim contact)
- Creates animated score messages and visual feedback
- Updates UI elements for scoring displays

#### 4. **CollisionSystem** (`src/systems/collisionSystem.js`)
- Manages rim collision detection with 48 collider spheres
- Handles hoop scoring detection using circular plane intersection
- Provides debug visualization for collision spheres
- Manages ball-rim physics interactions

#### 5. **SoundSystem** (`src/systems/soundSystem.js`)
- Loads and manages crowd cheering sound effects
- Plays random cheering sounds on successful shots
- Handles audio volume and playback controls

#### 6. **CameraSystem** (`src/systems/cameraSystem.js`)
- Manages camera presets (default, top, left hoop, right hoop)
- Handles orbit controls toggle functionality
- Manages window resize events
- Encapsulates all camera-related logic

#### 7. **GameManager** (`src/systems/gameManager.js`)
- Coordinates all game systems
- Manages the main game loop and updates
- Handles shot zone display updates
- Provides unified interface for game operations

## Refactored Main File (`hw5.js`)

### Before (Problems):
- **870+ lines** of mixed concerns
- Physics, scoring, UI, sound, collision all in one file
- Hard to maintain and debug
- Duplicate code and tangled dependencies

### After (Improvements):
- **~230 lines** focused on coordination
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular, testable, maintainable code
- Clear imports and system initialization
- Simplified event handling and animation loop

### Main File Structure Now:
```javascript
// 1. Clean imports - systems and infrastructure
import { BallPhysicsSystem } from './systems/ballPhysics.js';
import { ShootingSystem } from './systems/shootingSystem.js';
// ... other system imports

// 2. Basic scene setup (lighting, renderer, camera)

// 3. System initialization
const physicsSystem = new BallPhysicsSystem();
const shootingSystem = new ShootingSystem(scene);
// ... other systems

// 4. System coordination
gameManager.initializeSystems(/* all systems */);

// 5. Simple event handlers that delegate to systems
case 'w': shootingSystem.adjustShotPower(true); break;
case ' ': gameManager.shoot(); break;

// 6. Clean animation loop
gameManager.update(moveState, boundaries, delta);
```

## Benefits Achieved:

### 🏗️ **Modularity**
- Each system has a single responsibility
- Systems can be tested independently
- Easy to add new features without affecting others

### 🧹 **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier debugging and troubleshooting

### 📈 **Scalability**
- New systems can be added easily
- Individual systems can be enhanced independently
- Clear interfaces between components

### 🔧 **Testability**
- Each system can be unit tested
- Mock systems can be created for testing
- Clear dependencies and interfaces

### 📚 **Readability**
- Main file shows high-level game structure
- Implementation details are encapsulated
- Easy to understand code flow

## File Organization:
```
src/
├── hw5.js                    # Main coordination file (230 lines)
├── systems/                  # New modular systems
│   ├── ballPhysics.js       # Physics and rotation
│   ├── shootingSystem.js    # Shot power and trajectory
│   ├── scoringSystem.js     # Score tracking and feedback
│   ├── collisionSystem.js   # Rim collisions and detection
│   ├── soundSystem.js       # Audio effects
│   ├── cameraSystem.js      # Camera controls and presets
│   └── gameManager.js       # System coordination
└── ... (existing files unchanged)
```

## Next Steps for Further Improvement:
1. **Extract Lighting System** - Move lighting controls to separate module
2. **Configuration System** - Centralize game constants and settings
3. **Input System** - Dedicated keyboard/mouse input handling
4. **UI System** - More sophisticated UI management
5. **State Management** - Game state machine for different game modes

The refactoring successfully transforms a monolithic file into a clean, modular architecture while maintaining all existing functionality.
